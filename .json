Camunda offers an API to access\nthem and thereby manipulate the state of the process execution - one of the core features during process automation.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, as a user of the Camunda API, you have to exactly know the variable type (so the Java class behind it).\nFor example, if you store a String in a variable <code>&quot;orderId&quot;<\/code> you must extract it as a String in every piece of code.\nSince there is no code connection between the different code parts, but the BPMN process model orchestrates\nthese snippets to a single process execution, it makes refactoring and testing of process automation projects\nerror-prone and challenging.<\/p>\n<p>This library helps you to overcome these difficulties and make access, manipulation and testing process variables really\neasy and convenient. We leverage the Camunda API and offer you not only a better API but also some <a href=\"https://www.holunda.io/camunda-bpm-data/wiki/user-guide/features\">additional features<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-start\"><a href=\"#how-to-start\" id=\"how-to-start\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>How to start?<\/h2>\n<p>A good starting point is the <a href=\"./quick-start\">Quick Start<\/a>.
